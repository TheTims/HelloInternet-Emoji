# HelloInternet-Emoji
The goal is to create an emoji/sticker pack that would make Grey and Brady proud.

## How to contribute Emoji:

_This process may evolve._

To create a new emoji, or a new version of an existing emoji, create a folder with your username inside of a subfolder of emoji with the title of the emoji. Please submit a SVG (vector) image. Or at very least, an appropriately sized PNG (160x160), and issue a PULL request.

Example:
emoji/nail-and-gear/YOUR_USERNAME/nail-and-gear.svg
